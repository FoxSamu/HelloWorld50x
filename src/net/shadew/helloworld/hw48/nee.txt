Scene 19

ARTHUR:  O, Knights of Nee, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we
    go now?
HEAD KNIGHT:  It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.
    But there is one small problem.
ARTHUR:  What is that?
HEAD KNIGHT:  We are now... no longer the Knights Who Say Nee.
RANDOM:  Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Shh shh.  We are now the Knights Who Say Ecky-ecky-ecky-
    ecky-pikang-zoom-boing-(mumble-mumble).
RANDOM:  Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Therefore, we must give you a test.
ARTHUR:  What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently
    Said Nee?
HEAD KNIGHT:  Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery!
    [dramatic chord]
ARTHUR:  Not another shrubbery!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place
    it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get a
    two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.
RANDOM:  A path!  A path!  Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut
    down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!
    [dramatic chord]
ARTHUR:  We shall do no such thing!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Oh, please!
ARTHUR:  Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done.
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!  Aaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Don't say that word.
ARTHUR:  What word?
HEAD KNIGHT:  I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words
    the Knights of Nee cannot hear.
ARTHUR:  How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!  Aaaugh!
ARTHUR:  What, `is'?
HEAD KNIGHT:  No, not `is' -- we couldn't get very far in life not
    saying `is'.
BEDEMIR:  My liege, it's Sir Robin!
MINSTREL (singing):  Packing it in and packing it up
                     And sneaking away and buggering up
                     And chickening out and pissing about
                     Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge
ARTHUR:  Oh, Robin!
ROBIN:  My liege!  It's good to see you!
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT:  He said the word!
ARTHUR:  Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
MINSTREL (singing):  He is sneaking away and buggering up--
ROBIN:  Shut up!  No, no no-- far from it.
HEAD KNIGHT:  He said the word again!
ROBIN:  I was looking for it.
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
ROBIN:  Uh, here, here in this forest.
ARTHUR:  No, it is far from--
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!
ARTHUR:  Oh, stop it!
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Oh!  He said it again!
ARTHUR:  Patsy!
HEAD KNIGHT:  Aaugh!  I said it!  I said it!  Ooh!  I said it again!
KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
